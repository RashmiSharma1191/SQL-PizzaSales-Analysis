#SQL Pizza Sales Analysis 

In this project, I have used basic to intermediate-level SQL Queries to explore
Pizza Sales dataset of a company.

I have used various SQL techniques such as joins, sub-queries CTE's, etc to analyze
data.

Through thorough analysis of SQL Pizza Sales data, valuable insights can be gained to 
optimize marketing strategies, streamline inventory management, and enhance overall 
business performance. By understanding customer preferences, sales trends, and revenue 
drivers, the business can make data-driven decisions to drive growth and profitability 
in the competitive pizza market.
